# GCP Managed Instance Group and Load Balancer Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates the usage of Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Managed Instance Groups (MIG) combined with Load Balancers. The aim is to provide an efficient and scalable architecture for deploying applications in the cloud.

## Key Components
- **Managed Instance Group (MIG)**: Automatically manages the instances in a group, ensuring that the desired number of instances is running.
- **Load Balancer**: Distributes traffic to instances in the MIG, improving application availability and responsiveness.

## Features
- Auto-scaling: Automatically adjusts the number of instances based on the load.
- Health checks: Monitors the health of instances and replaces unhealthy ones.
- Centralized management: Simplifies the management of multiple instances and scaling policies.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository.
2. Set up GCP credentials.
3. Deploy the Managed Instance Group and Load Balancer configuration.

## Conclusion
This project serves as a guide to efficiently use GCP's Managed Instance Groups and Load Balancers to create a scalable and resilient application infrastructure.
